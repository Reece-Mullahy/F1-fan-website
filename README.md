# F1-fan-website

This site displays the driver standings and team standings in the current Formula 1 2023 season. There is also a feature where a user can
predict the results for the next race and see how the current driver standings will be affected by the selected race result. The new
standings displays each driver and their new position along with how many spots they moved up or down from their old position.
